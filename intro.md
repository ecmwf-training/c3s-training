# Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) Data Tutorials

**_Discover how to access and handle data of the past, present and future climate!_**

This website contains Jupyter notebook based tutorials that demonstrate how to access and process the wide variety of climate data provided by the [Climate Data Store (CDS)](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/) of the [Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S)](https://climate.copernicus.eu/). Each tutorial provides interactive examples of common workflows to derive information about the past, present and future climate. They include code in Python and content in Markdown to provide clear, engaging and practical instructions on data handling which can be run in various cloud environments without any need for installation. You are invited to experiment with these tutorials and tailor them to your needs to extract results meaningful to you! The tutorials make use of climate data freely available on the CDS and accessed using an Application Programming Interface (API).
