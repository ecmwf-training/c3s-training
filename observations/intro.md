# C3S Observation Tutorial

**PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS A DEVELOPMENT INSTANCE, THESE NOTE BOOKS ARE OFFICIALLY PUBLISHED ELSEWHERE**

This Jupyter book is a sub-module of the core C3S training material, it is published here for reviewing the
content prior to publication.

Satellite observations play a crucial role in monitoring various aspects of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, surface, and cryosphere. In addition they facilitate the monitoring of atmospheric composition, including greenhouse gases, aerosols, and ozone levels. This tutorial series delves into the utilization of satellite observations for various meteorological analyses and environmental monitoring.

## C3S Satellite-Observations (ECV) - Atmospheric Physics

This tutorial series explores the utilization of satellite data for comprehensive meteorological analyses and environmental monitoring of Atmospheric Physic parameters. 

There are tutorials for the following variables:
