# C3S observation tutorial

Satellite observations play a crucial role in monitoring various aspects of the Earthâ€™s atmosphere, surface, and cryosphere. In addition they facilitate the monitoring of atmospheric composition, including greenhouse gases, aerosols, and ozone levels. This tutorial series delves into the utilization of satellite observations for various meteorological analyses and environmental monitoring.
